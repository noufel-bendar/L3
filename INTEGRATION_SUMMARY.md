## 🔄 Data Flow

### Initial Load
1. App fetches academic years from `/api/drive-links/`
2. Loads exam resources for all specializations
3. Groups data by specialization type (ISIL vs ACAD)
4. Sets up initial state for user interactions

### User Interactions
1. User selects resource type (Drives, Videos, Exams, Summaries)
2. App makes specific API calls based on selection
3. Data is fetched and displayed with loading states
4. Error handling provides fallback options
